Then I reliased I was all on my own :( </br></br> The Monkeys were probably still a few hours away from landing in Singapore. I missed them but they were off on their own adventure. </br></br>I used all my chef skills opening a packet of oat cakes for breakfast, then I went for a walk in Rushmere Woods. </br> </br> I walked up to the balance logs, counting logs, big chair and climbed on the spider before walking home.  </br></br> After that I went into town, did some clouring at the library. It wasn't as much fun doing that on my own, so I went to get my haircut and got a 2x sasuage rolls (1x Black Pudding, 1x Firecracker) and a free coffee. </br></br> With my energy levels recharged, I had the power I needed to water Granny's garden and do a little bit of weeding for her. </br> </br> Now that the green bin was full. Granny rewarded me for doing her gardening she made me a Granny Ham and Mustard Sandwhich. Yummy!! </br></br>  Back home now as have lots of work todo for Monday. I've not made any plans for rest of the weekend.. but who knows what might happen next? "

In the message from Mum she said they were all well behaved on the plane.  </br></br>I wonder what the movies and games were like on the plane?  </br></br>They must have been good if the Monkeys were well behaved for the whole trip??  </br></br>I was more adventurous for breakfast today. I didn't have any pastries like we normally do on a Sunday. So, instead I had toast and the left over cheese and chorizo the monkeys left me in the fridge.  I got dressed, I did some work, took the bins out, watched some TV and watered our garden.  </br></br>With the monkeys being away I got to eat the raspberries. They were tasty. I checked out the sunflowers when I watered them. </br></br>Still only one yellow flower, but the other two look like they will flower soon. </br></br>I wonder what colours they will be? </br><br><img src='./images/sunflowers.jpeg' alt='Sunflowers' class='blog-image'>"

They were impressed that you could do that from the other side of the world.  </br></br> I wonder if the Monkeys did any timestables before playing that???  </br></br>On the weekend they went to Buzzstock Music festival and danced in the Sunshine. Sounded fun, but too hot for me to be dancing about in the Sunshine.  It has been 30 degrees for the last few days. Probably hotter than Austrailia?  Thankfully the office has air conditioning so it was nice and cool sitting at my desk. I had a busy day at work, with lots of long phone calls :( but it was someone's birthday and they brought in chocolate cake for us to share. So that was a nice treat. </br> </br>Afterwork I went to Granny's for my dinner. She cooked me pasta with pesto and I had some of Scott's ice cream.  </br></br>I wonder what my Monkeys have been doing in Austraila?? </br></br> Have they had any Austrailia food yet to tell me about?"

At the station there was a man giving out free samples of sweets.  They looked like maltesers but had a chewing middle.  I prefer malteasers.  </br></br>Nothing much going on at work today so I spent some time improving the Maths robot so that the Monkeys can practice while they are away. I am a bit worried that they might actually start to beat me soon. </br></br> I miss them :( </br></br> I can't wait to hear about their adventures in Oz."

Then hung the clothes out on the washing line to dry. </br></br> I had a nice chat with Granny while I was there, she said she was missing the Monkeys too. </br></br> After that I went to the shops and bought some food for the week.

There is still only one flower out on the sunflowers. But they all seems to be getting taller still so they will enjoy a big drink.  </br></br>The Monkeys called me today all the way from Austrailia. Sounds like they are having fun. Stories about plane, movies, swimming, footy matches, ice skating and meeting lots of the family. They are off to explore Nanna's home/town this week I can't wait to find out what they get up to there."

There was a rooftop party with a tennis theme.🎾</br></br> Apparently we were meant to have the week of the Wimbledon Final but so many people wanted to go to the party they had to change the date and find a larger venue.</br><br>It was a cool place and the weather was just right to be outside in the evening. They had an awseome BBQ with loads of nice food to try.</br></br>It was a fun night.. but getting home was not fun...</br></br>I got stuck on a train. It just stopped at a station for 40 mins.  Not sure why the train stopped but when we got a green light to progress I finally made it back to Granny's house.</br></br>I am glad she lives near the station and was ok with me sleeping over.</br></br>I got some cool treats for the Monekeys too. </br></br>(well if you like tennis it is a cool present 🎾 🎾 🎾).
