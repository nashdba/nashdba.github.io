I missed them but they were off on their own adventure. </br></br>I used all my chef skills opening a packet of oat cakes for breakfast, then I went for a walk in Rushmere Woods. </br> </br> I walked up to the balance logs, counting logs, big chair and climbed on the spider before walking home.  </br></br> After that I went into town, did some clouring at the library. It wasn't as much fun doing that on my own, so I went to get my haircut and got a 2x sasuage rolls (1x Black Pudding, 1x Firecracker) and a free coffee. </br></br> With my energy levels recharged, I had the power I needed to water Granny's garden and do a little bit of weeding for her. </br> </br> Now that the green bin was full. Granny rewarded me for doing her gardening she made me a Granny Ham and Mustard Sandwhich. Yummy!! </br></br>  Back home now as have lots of work todo for Monday. I've not made any plans for rest of the weekend.. but who knows what might happen next? "

I didn't have any pastries like we normally do on a Sunday. So, instead I had toast and the left over cheese and chorizo the monkeys left me in the fridge.  I got dressed, I did some work, took the bins out, watched some TV and watered our garden.  </br></br>With the monkeys being away I got to eat the raspberries. They were tasty. I checked out the sunflowers when I watered them. </br></br>Still only one yellow flower, but the other two look like they will flower soon. </br></br>I wonder what colours they will be? </br><br><img src='./images/sunflowers.jpeg' alt='Sunflowers' class='blog-image'>"

Sounded fun, but too hot for me to be dancing about in the Sunshine.  It has been 30 degrees for the last few days. Probably hotter than Austrailia?  Thankfully the office has air conditioning so it was nice and cool sitting at my desk. I had a busy day at work, with lots of long phone calls :( but it was someone's birthday and they brought in chocolate cake for us to share. So that was a nice treat. </br> </br>Afterwork I went to Granny's for my dinner. She cooked me pasta with pesto and I had some of Scott's ice cream.  </br></br>I wonder what my Monkeys have been doing in Austraila?? </br></br> Have they had any Austrailia food yet to tell me about?"

I prefer malteasers.  </br></br>Nothing much going on at work today so I spent some time improving the Maths robot so that the Monkeys can practice while they are away.

Sounds like they were having lots of fun.  Each of the Monkeys had so much to tell us about their adventures. </br></br>Kangaroos, tractor and motorbike rides, swimming and minecraft there was so much going on!!! </br></br>  Granny said she was worn out after the phone call listening to all the fun they were having.  She was very impressed with the grown up conversation each of the Monekys was capable of.  (Well done Monkeys!! - it is great to hear people recognising and praising your conversation skills and phone manners.) </br></br> The grass wasn't too long so was quick to cut.  It looks tidy now and is ready for Granny's visitors arriving later today.  Mvari and Douglas are coming to stay for a few days.
